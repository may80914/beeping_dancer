# beeping_dancer
[Our project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tr92i46cixHyOB9DI_k7jKac8ZrGuXn2V3lA_N0On08/edit?usp=sharing) first beeps "Spooky Scary Skeletons" then dances by using gears connected to a motor that rotate the head and limbs. To run, put your hand in front of the sensor. The ultrasonic distance sensor causes the program to dance and beep “Spooky Scary Skeletons” when it senses a nearby object. The frame is a large piece of cardboard with the cardboard limbs and head stuck on the front. On the other side is a system of gears connected to the limbs and the motor that causes the limbs to swivel back and forth. 

 
This robot was made by Vivi Wickersham and Maya Smith in their Autonomous Robotics class using the following links:

## What we learned
We learned how to use threading and how to program the robot to play a song. We also learned how to delete files from our brick and that it's important to check that connections between sensors and their ports have not failed in the code.
## What worked well
The robot successfully used threading to both play a song and dance. The song sounded good and the dance looked good.
## What we would do differently 
We would delete the extra files on our brick, leaving only the one we intend to execute, and we would check that the sensors work properly.
